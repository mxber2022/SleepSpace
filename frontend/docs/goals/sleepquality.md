# Sleep Quality

Sleep quality refers to how well you sleep during the night, not just how long you sleep. It’s a measure of how restorative and uninterrupted your sleep is. This document explains what sleep quality means, how it’s measured, and why it’s important for overall health.

## **What is Sleep Quality?**

Sleep quality is a combination of subjective and objective factors that determine how well you sleep. It includes:

1. **Sleep Efficiency**: The percentage of time spent asleep while in bed.
   - Example: If you spend 8 hours in bed but only sleep 6 hours, your sleep efficiency is 75%.

2. **Sleep Latency**: How long it takes you to fall asleep.
   - Example: Falling asleep within 20 minutes is considered good.

3. **Sleep Continuity**: How often you wake up during the night.
   - Example: Waking up once or twice is normal, but frequent awakenings reduce sleep quality.

4. **Sleep Stages**: The balance of light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep.
   - Example: Deep sleep is crucial for physical restoration, while REM sleep is important for mental health.

5. **Subjective Feelings**: How rested and refreshed you feel upon waking.
   - Example: Waking up feeling tired despite sleeping 8 hours indicates poor sleep quality.
